                <p>
                    is а Danish-Icelandic artist born in 1967 renowned for his
                    sculptures and large-scale art installations where he combines
                    materials such as light, water, wood and air temperature to deepen
                    the viewer’s experience. He is also an architect, product designer,
                    film-maker, photographer, culinary artist and eco-activist. Much of
                    his projects explore the common ground between space and nature and
                    art and science. Some of his art installations consider topics as
                    climate change, sustainability, nature and weather, self-awareness
                    and the perception of the reality.

                    Eliasson’s art concept is exploration of a real natural phenomenon,
                    which he interprets in a new and unexpected way and makes it an
                    unforgettable experience for the viewer. Experience is the key word
                    in his art. He often emphasizes that

                <br />
                <p>
                    He is passionate about reaching as much audience as possible and
                    involve it in his art projects. The audience is active part of his
                    exhibitions.

                    "The people who visit my exhibitions are actually the creators of
                    the project content. And this is no coincidence. I was always
                    interested in the question whether we are participants or creators
                    of art as visitors, because in fact our interpretation of any work
                    created by another artist is actually a new form of art."

                    Every project of Olafur Eliasson is an invitation to go beyond the
                    comfort zone and to explore new worlds. He believes that art can
                    have a strong impact on the world outside the museum. In many of his
                    works the boundaries between the inside and outside are dissolved.

                    The weather project was installed at the London's
                    <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/" class="hiperlink">Tate Modern</a>
                    in 2003 as part of the popular
                    <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series" class="hiperlink">Unilever series</a>. The installation is placed at the open space of the gallery's
                    Turbine Hall.<br />
                    With this incredible project, as with many of his works, he
                    expresses the relationship between nature and the city and how the
                    nature can be experienced in the city. He recreated a big yellow
                    burning sun inside the Turbine Hall where the visitors can just lay
                    down under it and enjoy the atmosphere it creates. Even dough it
                    looks warm the installation does not give out any additional heat.
                    The room is also filled with mist made of sugar and water. More than
                    300 mirrors were used for the ceiling so that the visitors could see
                    themselves as tiny black silhouettes against a mass of orange light
                    symbolizing the sun. Eliasson uses light, wind, steam, fire, water
                    and ice and combines these materials with modern technology in
                    unexpected ways. The installation is a kind of escape from the rainy
                    weather outside.<br />

                    Olafur's installation "Your rainbow panorama" is a glass
                    kaleidoscopic circular corridor which consists every color of the
                    spectrum and where you can walk inside. It reminds of a rainbow. It
                    is installed on the rooftop of the
                    <a href="https://en.aros.dk" class="hiperlink">ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum</a>
                    in Aarhus in May 2011.<br />
                    The idea of "Your Rainbow Panorama" is inspired by the poet Dante
                    Alighieri’s story in “The Divine Comedy” and is designed as a
                    journey from hell to paradise and the panorama on the rooftop
                    represents the heaven and the perfection. In 2004 ARoS Aarhus Art
                    Museum was designed as a metaphor for the Dante’s poem containing 9
                    galleries and a spectacular spiral staircase.<br />

                    Olafur Eliasson designed four giant waterfalls positioned in four
                    iconic historical places by Manhattan’s East river as
                    <a href="https://www.publicartfund.org/exhibitions/view/the-new-york-city-waterfalls/" class="hiperlink">public art</a>
                    for the city. He built the waterfalls using the scaffolding
                    technique which is a common feature of Manhattan.

                    “In developing The New York City Waterfalls, I have tried to work
                    with today’s complex notion of public spaces,” said Eliasson. “The
                    Waterfalls appear in the midst of the dense social, environmental,
                    and political tissue that makes up the heart of New York City. They
                    will give people the possibility to reconsider their relationships
                    to these spectacular surroundings, and I hope they will evoke
                    individual experiences and enhance a sense of collectivity.”

                    Eliasson's artworks provoke the senses and the creativity of the
                    audience and from passive observer makes us active participants
                    because he wants to establish a sense of “community”, “of being
                    together”, “of democracy”. [See his TED talk
